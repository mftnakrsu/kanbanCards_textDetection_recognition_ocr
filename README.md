# Kanban Cards Text Detection & Recognation & OCR

Scene Text Detection is a task to detect text regions in the complex background and label them with bounding boxes. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is the process that converts an image of text into a machine-readable text format. For example, if you scan a form or a receipt, your computer saves the scan as an image file. In this repo, kanban cards, which are widely used in production, were detected with scene text detection and read with scene text recognition. This is also an end to end OCR project.

# What is KANBAN ?

Kanban is a popular Lean workflow management method for defining, managing, and improving services that deliver knowledge work. It helps you visualize work, maximize efficiency, and improve continuously. Work is represented on Kanban boards, allowing you to optimize work delivery across multiple teams and handle even the most complex projects in a single environment.
